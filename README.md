# AirBnb_Project

Created a dashboard using Tableau <be>

[Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset)

The first dashboard was to find a profitable zip code to set up a house for Airbnb. It also looks at which time of year earns the most.

The second dashboard shows which zip code customers were satisfied with, and which types of houses require the most cleaning
